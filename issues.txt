> Routing and async methods 

Nuxt will execute the first async method in its page structure.
It wont execute another when routing to another page using NuxtLink 
RouterLink. Only using <a> will circumvent this

We could also use fetch which is ran every time when navigating
Fetch however, works only for store operations. So we could theoretically
get our component data via the after committing it to store on fetch
