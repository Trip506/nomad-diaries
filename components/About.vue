			Bupa Dental Care Penzance is on the High Street in the centre of the Cornish town of Penzance, just a five-minute walk from the beach. In our modern practice, we offer NHS and private dental services, and emergency appointments. We’re accepting new private patients to register, as well as referrals from other dentists for implants.
			Our location is not only convenient for our patients but for efficiency, as we can offer a quick turnaround on any lab work since we use a local provider on the next street.
			Our team of dentists are experienced practitioners and include an implant dentist. They’re all supported by a large team of friendly nurses.
